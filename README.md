In America, an average of 1 in 15 black Americans commits a crime. The crime rate of this group is 2.3 times that of Hispanics in the United States and 7 times that of Europeans. Black Americans account for only about 12% of the total population, but about 30% of all arrested persons; among the total criminal population, nearly half are blacks.
All Asians have been harassed by blacks, so is it BLM or YLB (Yellow Lives Better)?
